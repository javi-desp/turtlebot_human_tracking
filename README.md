# turtlebot_human_tracking
A ROS package for turtlebot3 that implements human detection and a tracking. 


The 'MobileNetSSD' files define a trained machine learning model that can be used for a variety of object detection implementations. Here we use person detection.

A 'webcam_tracker.py' script is included as a demonstration of the person tracking portion of the project. This script should run without problems if you have a webcam on your computer and the 'MobileNetSSD' modules in the same directory as the script (you'll need to change the paths when loading the modules in the script, line 21). This script does nothing with the TurtleBot. More documentation and information on how the tracking is done can be found at: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/09/18/real-time-object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-opencv/

See the wiki attached to this repo for more detailed information on the project and how it was completed.
