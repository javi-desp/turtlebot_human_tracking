# turtlebot_human_tracking
A ROS package for turtlebot3 that implements human detection and a tracking. 


## Trained network
In the folder trained_network there are alocated the files that define the pretrained machine learning model 'MobileNetSSD'. This can be used for several object detection, however, in this case we will use only the human detections. 


## Python Code
The python code 'human_tracking.py' is the only code necessary to run the detection & human tracking.

## Simulation environment
In order to verify the human detection and tracking we have used a gazebo world in which models of people appear walking randomly.
